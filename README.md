- difference between functional or procedural programming and object oriented programming

## 4 important pillars of OOP

### 1. encapsulation

- a structure or blueprint which brings all the general behavior in a same place. we make it happen using class
- property could be public(accessible from outside of class) or private(indirect accessible -> uses front hash on the property)

### 2. inheritance

- a functionality where a class gets access of similar properties of previous classes using super()

### 3. abstraction

- is the superset where we do not know the inner functionality but we can use the function.

-> driver drives a car using staring wheel and paddle but, dose'nt know engine's inner working.

### 4. polymorphism (many structure or shape)

-> poly means: many
-> morpheus means: structure or shape

- same function in different classes and different shape
